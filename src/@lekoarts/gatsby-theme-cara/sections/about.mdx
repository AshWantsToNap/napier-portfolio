## About

I have been addicted to games since I first got my grubby little hands 
on a Super Nintendo and Mega Man X. Once I beat my first boss? The 
deal was done. I enjoy writing about video games from reviews, to guides, to news, to just plain hype. Now, I'm going back to school to learn game development so I can give back to the industry that has given me so much already.

P.S. Blame Chill Penguin
